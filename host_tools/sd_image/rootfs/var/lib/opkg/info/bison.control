Package: bison
Version: 3.0.4-r0.0
Description: GNU Project parser generator (yacc replacement)
 Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an annotated
 context-free grammar into an LALR(1) or GLR parser for that grammar.
 Bison is upward compatible with Yacc: all properly-written Yacc grammars
 ought to work with Bison with no change. Anyone familiar with Yacc should
 be able to use Bison with little trouble.
